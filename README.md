metastrings is a NoSQL database extension to MySQL or SQLite, your choice.  

It is a .NET 5 solution, so you can run it on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

I invite brutal criticism, and substantial contributions.  

I'm new to git, and this is my first open source project, so please play nice and don't assume much.

Visit https://www.metastrings.io for detailed documentation.  Enjoy.
